## Welcome! Here, you can download my Excel macro files.
I'm Jess Obie and I created these Excel macros as part of my work at Binghamton University Libraries. I'm making these files available as part of my Excel Macro presentation for the IDS Project's Virtual User Group event in May 2024. I don't believe that these macros will be useable for anyone else out-of-the-box, since there is a lot of code specific to Binghamton University's Alma configuration, but I am hopeful that they might be able to help you get started making your own. I hope by reviewing the files that you are able to learn more about the functions and syntax of VBA, and get some ideas for macros that you want to write for your workflows. I have learned a lot since creating some of these files, and have much more to learn, so there are many places where my code could be improved.
Please feel free to download and look through these files, and adapt the code to your work.

### ExpiredHoldShelf.vbs
This macro formats the expired hold shelf Alma export to a printable pull list so our staff can pull expired holds off of the hold shelf.

### FormatBookstoreList.vbs
This macro formats the export from our textbook vendor into a readable format for our course reserves staff to go through and process.

### ISBNisolate.vbs
This macro finds the ISBN column in any file and deletes all other information. I was then uploading the file into Alma to make an itemized title set.

### NextDateArray.vbs
This macro helped me combine 24 cells of hourly data into 1 cell of daily data, over and over again.

### PickFromShelfLending.vbs
This macro formats the pick list from Alma into a pullable list for staff to take to the stacks.

### SeparateAlmaSet.vbs
This macro takes the export of an Alma set and separates it into different sheets by location.
